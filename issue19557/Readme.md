# QuantConnect Dataset Issue #19557: Missing Crypto Futures Minute Data (BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT)

## Overview

This issue concerns missing minute-resolution historical data for **BTCUSDT** and **ETHUSDT** crypto futures on the **Binance** market, as accessed via QuantConnect. The data gap occurs **between February 4, 2025, 12:00 AM and April 24, 2025, 12:00 AM**, specifically when queried with **fill-forward disabled**.

The missing data affects close prices (and potentially other OHLCV fields), leading to visible gaps in charts and inaccurate analysis results.

## Reproduction with QuantBook

The following code demonstrates the issue using QuantConnectâ€™s QuantBook environment:

```python
from AlgorithmImports import *

qb = QuantBook()
symbol = qb.add_crypto_future("BTCUSDT", market=Market.BINANCE, fill_forward=False).symbol
history = qb.history(symbol, datetime(2025,2,1), datetime(2025,5,1), Resolution.MINUTE)
history.droplevel('symbol').close.plot()

## Root Cause Analysis

QuantConnect sources crypto futures data from **CoinAPI**, which aggregates data from Binanceâ€™s public APIs and public data feeds. Upon investigation, the missing data appears to be caused by **upstream issues on Binance's end** rather than a bug within QuantConnect.

### Contributing Events

1. **Binance Platform Outage â€” February 2025**  
   A significant outage impacted account access and trading operations. This likely delayed historical data processing.

2. **Crypto Market Crash â€” March 9, 2025**  
   Amid U.S. trade tariffs, the crypto market saw a sharp decline (20.2% in February), causing extreme volatility. This may have overwhelmed Binanceâ€™s data logging infrastructure.

3. **AWS Outage in Tokyo â€” April 15, 2025**  
   A widespread AWS outage affected Binance services, disrupting network access and temporarily halting withdrawals. This likely interfered with Binance's data feeds and historical data continuity.

4. **Binance GitHub Data Delay â€” Post-February 2025**  
   Binanceâ€™s public data repository shows that monthly kline updates (including spot and futures) were delayed or missing after February 2025.

The above events align with the observed missing data period (**Feb 4 to Apr 24, 2025**), indicating that the issue originates from **Binance's data availability** and was propagated via CoinAPI to QuantConnect.

## Verification: Estimating Missing Minutes

To validate the data gap, we compare the expected number of minute-resolution data points to the actual returned count.

### Expected Minute Bars

- **Date Range:** Feb 1 â€“ May 1, 2025 = 89 days  
- **Minutes per Day:** 1440  
- **Total Expected Minutes:** Expected = 89 * 1440 = 128,160 


### Missing Period (Feb 4 â€“ Apr 24, 2025)

- **Total Missing Days:**  
- February: 24 days (Feb 4â€“29)  
- March: 31 days  
- April: 24 days (Apr 1â€“24)  
- **Total:** 79 days  
- **Total Missing Minutes:**  so missing minutes = 79*1440 = 113,760.
